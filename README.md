# eight_queens
A program that places 8 queens on an 8x8 board where none of the queens are in conflict with each other.
This is accomplished using the Hill-Climbing algorithm with random restarts.

The 8-Queens problem requires that 8 queens be placed on a board with 8 rows and columns so that no queen occupies the same row, column or diagonal as another queen.  To solve this problem using the Hill-Climbing with random restart algorithm, we must first generate a random starting state which places a queen in a random row of each column. From there, we first check to see if the state is a goal state (no queens are in conflict). If not, we evaluate all of the possible neighbor states by moving each column’s queen through the rows of its column and generating a heuristic value for each of those states.  When all of the neighbor states have been generated, we check to see if any states were generated that have a lower heuristic value than the current state.  If a better state was not found, then we have reached the local minima and must perform a random restart.  If a better (lower heuristic) state was found, then that state becomes the current state and the above process is repeated on that state.
